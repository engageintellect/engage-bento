## Managing Raspberry Pis and Other Linux Servers with Cockpit

Managing multiple Raspberry Pis and other Linux servers can be a hassle, especially when dealing with various configurations and monitoring needs. Cockpit is a powerful web-based interface that simplifies system administration by providing an easy-to-use dashboard. This article will guide you through setting up Cockpit on Ubuntu (or any other Linux distro) for managing Raspberry Pis and other Linux servers.

### What is Cockpit?

Cockpit is an open-source web-based interface that allows you to manage and monitor multiple Linux servers. It provides a graphical interface for tasks such as:

- Monitoring system performance
- Managing system services
- Configuring network settings
- Viewing logs
- Managing storage
- Administering users and groups

### Why Use Cockpit?

Cockpit is lightweight and easy to set up, making it an ideal tool for both beginners and experienced system administrators. Its key features include:

- **Real-time monitoring**: View system performance metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity.
- **Ease of use**: Manage multiple servers from a single dashboard with a user-friendly interface.
- **Extensibility**: Cockpit supports plugins, allowing you to extend its functionality to suit your needs.
- **Remote access**: Manage servers remotely via a web browser.

### Setting Up Cockpit on Ubuntu

Here’s a step-by-step guide to installing and configuring Cockpit on Ubuntu.

#### Step 1: Install Cockpit

First, update your system packages using your distro's package manager. For Ubuntu, we'll be using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Then, install Cockpit using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install cockpit
```

#### Step 2: Enable and Start Cockpit Service

Enable the Cockpit service to start on boot and start it immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
```

Verify that Cockpit is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cockpit
```

You should see that the `cockpit.service` is active and running.

#### Step 3: Access Cockpit Web Interface

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```bash
https://<your_server_ip>:9090
```

Replace `<your_server_ip>` with the IP address of your Ubuntu server. If you are accessing Cockpit locally, you can use `localhost`:

```bash
https://localhost:9090
```

You will be prompted with a security warning because the connection is not yet secured. Bypass the warning to proceed.

#### Step 4: Log In

Log in with your Ubuntu user credentials. These are the same username and password you use to log in to your server.

### Securing Cockpit with SSL

To secure your Cockpit interface with SSL, you can use Let's Encrypt to obtain a free SSL certificate or create a self-signed certificate.

#### Using Let's Encrypt

1. **Install Certbot**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot
   ```

2. **Obtain an SSL Certificate**:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
   ```

   Follow the prompts to complete the certificate request.

3. **Configure Cockpit to Use the Certificate**:

   Edit the Cockpit configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf
   ```

   Add or modify the following lines:

   ```ini
   [WebService]
   UseTLS = true
   KeyFile = /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
   CertificateFile = /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
   ```

4. **Restart Cockpit**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart cockpit
   ```

5. **Set Up Automatic Renewal**:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line:

   ```bash
   0 3 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet && systemctl restart cockpit
   ```

#### Using a Self-Signed Certificate

1. **Generate a Self-Signed Certificate**:

   ```bash
   sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/ssl/private/cockpit-selfsigned.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/ssl/certs/cockpit-selfsigned.crt
   ```

2. **Configure Cockpit to Use the Certificate**:

   Edit the Cockpit configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf
   ```

   Add or modify the following lines:

   ```ini
   [WebService]
   UseTLS = true
   KeyFile = /etc/ssl/private/cockpit-selfsigned.key
   CertificateFile = /etc/ssl/certs/cockpit-selfsigned.crt
   ```

3. **Restart Cockpit**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart cockpit
   ```

### Adding and Managing Multiple Servers

Once you have Cockpit set up on your primary server, you can add and manage additional servers from the same interface.

1. **Install Cockpit on Additional Servers**:

   Repeat the installation steps on each additional Raspberry Pi or Linux server.

2. **Add Servers to Cockpit Dashboard**:

   On your primary Cockpit server, go to the "Dashboard" tab and click "Add Server." Enter the IP address and credentials of the additional server.

### Conclusion

Cockpit is a powerful and versatile tool for managing multiple Raspberry Pis and other Linux servers. Its web-based interface simplifies system administration tasks, making it easier to monitor and manage your infrastructure. By following this guide, you can set up Cockpit on Ubuntu, secure it with SSL, and manage multiple servers from a single dashboard. Enjoy the ease and efficiency that Cockpit brings to your system administration tasks.
